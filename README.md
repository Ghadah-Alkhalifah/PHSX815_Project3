# PHSX815_Project3: Estimating the Probability of getting Heads in a Coin Flip Experiment
## How to run code:
1/ Start with `file1.py` it will print the estimated probablity of heads(alpha) with different number of tosses. Also, it will write text file `errbar.txt` for the estimated probablity with convidence intervals. This this will plot the likelihood function with the number of flips. You are able to change the `-seed' and `-Alpha` from terminal.
2/ run `file2.py` it will plot the true and estimated probability for n flips and show the erorr bars. 
## Code:
python with Numpy and matplotlib
